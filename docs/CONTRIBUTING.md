### Project Priorities

The [project kanban board] is where I prioritize tasks.
I want to touch on most major functionality of JPL's Horizons before I try to make any component feature-complete.
Correctness of response is also a high priority, so if you are aware of any bug that yields incorrect data, please submit an issue.

### Using Horizons?

If you're using this API for any reason, I'd love to hear from you to understand your use case and priorities.
This is a hobby project, and I don't use the API myself, so user feedback would be wonderful.

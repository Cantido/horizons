= HORIZONS API
Robert Richter <robert.c.richter@gmail.com>

A RESTful-style API  for http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?horizons[NASA's HORIZONS system],
written in Clojure.

== Introduction

The http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?horizons[HORIZONS] system provides a model for the solar system. Through it, queries
can be made to find the positions of planets, asteroids, comets, and other
solar system objects.

[quote, NASA's documentation for the HORIZONS system]
____
The JPL HORIZONS on-line solar system data and ephemeris computation service
provides access to key solar system data and flexible production of highly
accurate ephemerides for solar system objects ( 728955 asteroids, 3451 comets,
178 planetary satellites, 8 planets, the Sun, L1, L2, select spacecraft, and
system barycenters ). HORIZONS is provided by the Solar System Dynamics Group of
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
____

The only ways to access HORIZONS are through `telnet`, email, and a CGI web
interface intended for end-user access. I want to provide a modern REST-style
JSON interface to this system. It's written in https://clojure.org/[Clojure],
using http://clojure-liberator.github.io/liberator/[Liberator] to handle the
details of RESTful representations.

== Usage

This application is built using https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen[Leiningen]
and https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring[Ring], so you can easily start a
development server using the https://github.com/weavejester/lein-ring[lein-ring] plugin:

[source, bash]
----
lein ring server
----

See the documentation on `lein-ring` for details.

Beyond that, I'm still working on `telnet` access to the HORIZONS API.
There are no endpoints implemented yet.

== Roadmap

I plan to implement functionality in this order:

1. *Access the HORIZONS `telnet` API successfully*
1. Get current orbital coordinates for Earth
1. Get past or future orbital coordinates for Earth
1. Get past or future orbital coordinates for any planet in the Solar System

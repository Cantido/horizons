# HORIZONS API

A RESTful-style API for NASA's [HORIZONS] system,
written in Clojure.

## Introduction

The [HORIZONS] system provides a model for the solar system.
Through it, queries can be made to find the positions of planets, asteroids, comets, and
other astronomical bodies.
This kind of data base is sometimes called an *ephemeredes* (singular *ephemeris*).

> The JPL HORIZONS on-line solar system data and ephemeris computation service
provides access to key solar system data and flexible production of highly
accurate ephemerides for solar system objects ( 728955 asteroids, 3451 comets,
178 planetary satellites, 8 planets, the Sun, L1, L2, select spacecraft, and
system barycenters ). HORIZONS is provided by the Solar System Dynamics Group of
 the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

The only ways to access HORIZONS are through `telnet`, email, and
a CGI web interface intended for end-user access.
I want to provide a modern REST-style JSON interface to this system.
 
This application is written in [Clojure],
and uses [Liberator] to handle the details of RESTful representations.

## Usage

This application is built using [Leiningen] and [Ring],
so you can easily start a development server using the [lein-ring] plugin:

```bash
lein ring server
```

See the documentation on `lein-ring` for details.

Beyond that, I'm still working on `telnet` access to the HORIZONS API.
There are no endpoints implemented yet.

## Roadmap

I plan to implement functionality in this order:

1. ~~Access the HORIZONS `telnet` API successfully~~
1. **Return geophysical data for Mars at `/499`**
1. Return geophysical data for all 8 planets at `/{id}`
1. Return ephemeris data for all 8 planets in the default time-frame
1. Above, but in a configurable time-frame
1. Above, but for all bodies
1. Expose 100% of HORIZON's `telnet` functionality via HTTP
